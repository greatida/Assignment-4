Sheepdog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is
Measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
Something special when you smile?

Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is
Measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
To listen to you fears

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is
Measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me
