When I get older losing my hair,
many years from now;
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
when I'm sixty-four?
(Musical bridge)
You'll be older too;
and if you say the word,
I could stay with you.
I could be handy, mending a fuse
when your lights have gone;
You can knit a sweater by the fireside;
sunday mornings go for a ride;
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
when I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent
a cottage in the Isle of Wight
if it's not too dear
we shall scrimp and save.
Grandchildren on your knee:
Vera, Chuck & Dave.
Send me a postcard,
drop me a line
Give me your answer.
You'll be older too.
